# ft_blacklist  
This script reloads your ```profile.intra.42.fr``` page every 5 minutes to check if there's an imminent correction within 15 minutes.  
If there is, checks the username against the blacklist. If username exists in blacklist, clicks the x to cancel the appointment.  
## TODO
1. embed code into a chrome extension  
2. create settings page for user-entered blacklist  
3. additional features
